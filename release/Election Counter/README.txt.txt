Election Counter:
Since grades are different, this program will need to be configured once for each election (eg once for grade 9 representatives, once for grade 11 representatives)


Usage:
1. download the poll results as a .csv file and paste it into the same folder as this file
2. take the email list file and paste it into the same folder as this file
3. go to settings.txt and configure lines 2, 5, and 8 as required
	a) line 2 should be the exact file name of the email list
	b) line 5 should be a single number, indicating the grade of the current election
	c) line 8 should be the file name of the poll results .csv file
4. run the program
5. open the output folder and use the results
